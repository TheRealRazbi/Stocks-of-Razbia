# Stocks of Razbia
Welcome, Stocks of Razbia is a stock exchange simulation simplified to work on a twitch chat. <br>
This project was made by Razbi and Nesami.

## Installation
Here are the releases: https://github.com/TheRealRazbi/Stocks-of-Razbia/releases <br>
As long as you read the Notes on each release, before installing it, you should be fine.

## How does it work?
### Each 10 mins:

- 2 companies spawn until they reach 7 companies in total
- price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
- users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
- companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money

### Basic Commands:

- !stocks | displays all the basic commands
- !autoinvest &lt;budget&gt; | buy random stocks whose value approach the budget value
- !buy &lt;company&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | amount is a number or 'all'
- !sell &lt;company&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | amount is a number or 'all'
- !companies | display all companies
- !company &lt;company&gt; | show info about a company such as full-name and price

### Extra commands:

- !my stats | displays your shares + income + profit
- !my shares | displays all the shares you own
- !my profit | it will show you all the profit from all points invested [doesn't take into account the value of current shares]
- !my points | shows your points [in case the minigame uses a different currency system than streamer's]
- !my income | shows your income from all companies
- !introduction | displays a link to the Introduction document, which is a close copy to this one
- !about | displays the dev names and the github link
- !all commands | displays literally ALL the commands

### Note:
The minigame and all companies are hosted locally.
As this is currently in the testing version, everything is subject to change.

### Supports:
 
- Streamlabs Extension Currency
- StreamElements Currency
- Streamlabs Chatbot Local Currency
- Streamlabs Cloudbot [not yet, because it has no API support, so I have to do some webscrapping]
- Fully Local Currency [not yet, I will add it whenever Streamers will ask for it]
