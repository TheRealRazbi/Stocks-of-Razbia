# Stocks of Razbia
Welcome, Stocks of Razbia is a stock exchange simulation simplified to work on a twitch chat. <br>
This project was made by Razbi and Nesami.

## Installation
Here are the releases: https://github.com/TheRealRazbi/Stocks-of-Razbia/releases <br>
As long as you read the Notes on each release, before installing it, you should be fine.

## How does it work?
### Each 10 mins:

- 2 companies spawn until they reach 7 companies in total
- price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
- users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
- companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money

### Commands List:

- !stocks | display all commands
- !buy &lt;company&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | amount is a number or 'all'
- !sell &lt;company&gt; &lt;amount&gt; | amount is a number or 'all'
- !companies | to show all companies
- !company &lt;company&gt; | show info about a company such as full-name or price
- !my shares | it will show you all the shares you own
- !my profit | it will show you all the profit from all points invested
- !my points | shows your points [in case the minigame uses a different currency system than streamer's]
- !my income | shows your income from all companies
- !introduction | displays a link to the Introduction document, which is the same as this one
- !autoinvest &lt;budget&gt; | buy random stocks whose value approach the budget value

### Note:
The minigame and all companies are hosted locally.
As this is currently in the testing version, everything is subject to change.
