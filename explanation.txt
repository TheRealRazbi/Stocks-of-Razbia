In this minigame users can buy and sell stocks for companies.
Each 30 min irl means 1 month in-game:  
Each month: 
-5 companies spawn until they reach 10 companies in total
-price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
-users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
-an announcement appears talking about the price change on top 3 highest priced companies
-the announcement prioritizes the companies where users have stocks at
-as each company gets older, it has a higher chance of losing more and more money
-if a company gets bankrupt, it is being announced and it refunds a small amount of money to everyone who had stocks at that company
-companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money



The minigame and all companies are hosted locally.
As this is currently in the testing version, everything is subject to change.
