In this minigame users can buy and sell stocks for companies.
Each 30 min irl means 1 month in-game:  
Each month: 
-5 companies spawn until they reach 10 companies in total
-price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
-users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
-an announcement appears talking about the price change on top 3 highest priced companies
-the announcement prioritizes the companies where users have stocks at
-as each company gets older, it has a higher chance of losing more and more money
-if a company gets bankrupt, it is being announced and it refunds a small amount of money to everyone who had stocks at that company
-companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money
