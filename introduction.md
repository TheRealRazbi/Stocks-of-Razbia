In this minigame users can buy and sell stocks from companies to gain passive income or to buy when price is low and sell when the price is high make a profit.

Each 10 mins:

- 2 companies spawn until they reach 7 companies in total
- price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
- users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
- companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money

Commands List:

- !stocks | display all commands
- !buy <company> <amount> | amount is a number or 'all'
- !sell <company> <amount> | amount is a number or 'all'
- !companies | to show all companies
