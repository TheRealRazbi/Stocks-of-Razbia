Each 10 mins:

- 2 companies spawn until they reach 7 companies in total
- price of each existing company goes up or down randomly
- users gain points equal to 10% of the value of the stocks they own
- companies, the users have stocks at, are slightly more likely to gain more money

Basic Commands:

- !stocks | displays all the basic commands
